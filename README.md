# Bocadillo

Inspired by [Responder](http://python-responder.org), Bocadillo is a web framework that combines ideas from Falcon and Flask while leveraging modern Python async capabilities.

Under the hood, it uses the [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io) ASGI toolkit and the [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org) ASGI server.

## Quick start

Write your first app:

```python
# app.py
import bocadillo

api = bocadillo.API()

@api.route('/add/{x:d}/{y:d}')
async def add(req, resp, x: int, y: int):
    resp.media = {'result': x + y}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    api.run()
```

Run it:

```bash
python app.py
```

```
INFO: Started server process [81910]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Make some requests!

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/add/1/2"
{"result": 3}
```

## Install

Bocadillo can be installed from source or from PyPI:

```bash
pip install bocadillo
```

## Usage

It all starts with an import:

```python
import bocadillo
api = bocadillo.API()
```

### API

The main object you'll manipulate in Bocadillo is the `API`  object, an
ASGI-compliant application.

#### Running a Bocadillo app

To run a Bocadillo app, either run the application directly:

```python
# myapp.py
import bocadillo

api = bocadillo.API()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    api.run()
```

```bash
python myapp.py
```

Or give it to [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org)
(an ASGI server installed with Bocadillo):

```bash
uvicorn myapp:api
```

#### Configuring host and port

By default, Bocadillo serves your app on `127.0.0.1:8000`,
i.e. `localhost` on port 8000.

To customize the host and port, you can:

- Specify them on `app.run()`:

```python
api.run(host='mydomain.org', port=5045)
```

- Set the `PORT` environment variable. Bocadillo will pick
it up and automatically use the host `0.0.0.0` to accept all existing hosts
on the machine. This is especially useful when running the app in a
container or on a cloud hosting service. If needed, you can still specify
the `host` on `app.run()`.

#### Debug mode

You can toggle debug mode (full display of traceback in responses + hot reload)
by passing `debug=True` to `app.run()`:

```python
api.run(debug=True)
```

or passing the --debug flag to uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn myapp:api --debug
```

#### Configuring allowed hosts

By default, a Bocadillo API can run on any host. To specify which hosts are allowed, use `allowed_hosts`:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(allowed_hosts=['mysite.com'])
```

If a non-allowed host is used, all requests will return a 400 error.

### Views

In Bocadillo, views are functions that take at least a request and a response
as arguments, and mutate those objects as necessary.

Views can be asynchronous or synchronous, function-based or class-based.

#### Asynchronous views

The recommended way to define views in Bocadillo is using the async/await syntax. This allows you to call arbitrary async/await
Python code:

```python
from asyncio import sleep

async def find_post_content(slug: str):
    await sleep(1)  # perhaps query a database here?
    return 'My awesome post'

async def retrieve_post(req, res, slug: str):
    res.text = await find_post_content(slug)
```

#### Synchronous views

While Bocadillo is asynchronous at its core, you can also use plain Python functions to define synchronous views:

```python
def index(req, res):
    res.html = '<h1>My website</h1>'
```

**Note**: it is generally more
efficient to use asynchronous views rather than synchronous ones.
This is because, when given a synchronous view, Bocadillo needs to perform
a sync-to-async conversion, which might add extra overhead.

#### Class-based views

The previous examples were function-based views, but Bocadillo also supports
class-based views.

Class-based views are regular Python classes (there is no base `View` class).
Each HTTP method gets mapped to the corresponding method on the
class. For example, `GET` gets mapped to `.get()`,
`POST` gets mapped to `.post()`, etc.

Other than that, class-based view methods are just regular views:

```python
class Index:

    async def get(self, req, res):
        res.text = 'Classes, oh my!'
       
    def post(self, req, res):
        res.text = 'Roger that'
```

A catch-all `.handle()` method can also be implemented to process all incoming
requests â€” resulting in other methods being ignored.

```python
class Index:

    async def handle(self, req, res):
        res.text = 'Post it, get it, put it, delete it.'
```

### Routing

#### Route declaration

To declare and register a new route, use the `@api.route()` decorator:

```python
@api.route('/')
async def index(req, res):
    res.text = 'Hello, Bocadillo!'
```

#### Route parameters

Bocadillo allows you to specify route parameters as named template
literals in the route pattern (which uses the F-string syntax). Route parameters
are passed as additional arguments to the view:

```python
@api.route('/posts/{slug}')
async def retrieve_post(req, res, slug: str):
    res.text = 'My awesome post'
```

#### Route parameter validation

You can leverage [F-string specifiers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language) to add lightweight validation
to routes:

```python
# Only decimal integer values for `x` will be accepted
@api.route('/negation/{x:d}')
async def negate(req, res, x: int):
    res.media = {'result': -x}
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/negation/abc"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
server: uvicorn
date: Wed, 07 Nov 2018 20:24:31 GMT
content-type: text/plain
transfer-encoding: chunked

Not Found
```

#### Named routes

You can specify a name for a route by passing `name` to `@api.route()`:

```python
@api.route('/about/{who}', name='about')
async def about(req, res, who):
    res.html = f'<h1>About {who}</h1>'
```

In code, you can get the full URL path to a route using `api.url_for()`:

```python
>>> api.url_for('about', who='them')
'/about/them'
```

In templates, you can use the `url_for()` global:

```jinja2
<h1>Hello, Bocadillo!</h1>
<p>
    <a href="{{ url_for('about', who='me') }}">About me</a>
</p>
```

**Note**: referencing to a non-existing named route with `url_for()` will return a 404 error page.

#### Specifying HTTP methods (function-based views only)

By default, a route accepts all HTTP methods. On function-based views,
you can use the `methods` argument to `@api.route()` to specify the set of
HTTP methods being exposed:

```python
@api.route('/', methods=['get'])
async def index(req, res):
    res.text = "Come GET me, bro"
```

**Note**: the `methods` argument is ignored on class-based views.
You should instead decide which methods are implemented on the class to control
the exposition of HTTP methods.

### Requests

Request objects in Bocadillo expose the same interface as the
[Starlette Request](https://www.starlette.io/requests/). Common usage is
documented here.

#### Method

The HTTP method of the request is available at `req.method`.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000"
```

```python
req.method  # 'POST'
```

#### URL

The full URL of the request is available as `req.url`:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/foo/bar?add=sub"
```

```python
req.url  # 'http://localhost:8000/foo/bar?add=sub'
```

It is in fact a string-like object that also exposes individual parts:

```python
req.url.path  # '/foo/bar'
req.url.port  # 8000
req.url.scheme  # 'http'
req.url.hostname  # '127.0.0.1'
req.url.query  # 'add=sub'
req.url.is_secure  # False
```

#### Headers

Request headers are available at `req.headers`, an immutable, case-insensitive
Python dictionary.

```bash
curl -H 'X-App: Bocadillo' "http://localhost:8000"
```

```python
req.headers['x-app']  # 'Bocadillo'
req.headers['X-App']  # 'Bocadillo'
```

#### Query parameters

Query parameters are available at `req.query_params`, an immutable Python
dictionary-like object.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000?add=1&sub=2&sub=3"
```

```python
req.query_params['add']  # '1'
req.query_params['sub']  # '2'  (first item)
req.query_params.getlist('sub')  # ['2', '3']
```

#### Body

In Bocadillo, **the response body is an awaitable**, which means it can
only be used inside **asynchronous** views.

You can retrieve it in several ways, depending on the expected encoding:

- Bytes : `await req.body()`
- Form data: `await req.form()`
- JSON: `await req.json()`
- Stream (advanced usage): `async for chunk in req.stream(): ...`

### Responses

Bocadillo passes the request and the response object to each view, much like
Falcon does.
To send a response, the idiomatic process is to mutate the `res` object directly.

#### Sending content

Bocadillo has built-in support for common types of responses:

```python
res.text = 'My awesome post'  # text/plain
res.html = '<h1>My awesome post</h1>'  # text/html
res.media = {'title': 'My awesome post'}  # application/json
```

Setting a response type attribute automatically sets the
appropriate `Content-Type`, as depicted above.

If you need to send another content type, use `.content` and set
the `Content-Type` header yourself:

```python
res.content = 'h1 { color; gold; }'
res.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/css'
```

#### Status codes

You can set the numeric status code on the response using `res.status_code`:

```python
@api.route('/jobs', methods=['post'])
async def create_job(req, res):
    res.status_code = 201
```

> Bocadillo does not provide an enum of HTTP status codes. If you prefer to
use one, you'd be safe enough going for `HTTPStatus`, located in the standard
library's `http` module.
> 
> ```python
> from http import HTTPStatus
> res.status_code = HTTPStatus.CREATED.value
> ```

#### Headers

You can access and modify a response's headers using `res.headers`, which is
a standard Python dictionary object:

```python
res.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-cache'
```

### Redirections

Inside a view, you can redirect to another page using `api.redirect()`, which can be used in a few ways.

#### By route name

Use the `name` argument:

```python
@api.route('/home', name='home')
async def home(req, res):
    res.text = f'This is home!'

@api.route('/')
async def index(req, res):
    api.redirect(name='home')
```

**Note**: route parameters can be passed as additional keyword arguments.

#### By URL

You can redirect by URL by passing `url`. The URL can be internal (path relative to the server's host) or external (absolute URL).

```python
@api.route('/')
async def index(req, res):
    # internal:
    api.redirect(url='/home')
    # external:
    api.redirect(url='http://localhost:8000/home')
```

#### Permanent redirections

Redirections are temporary (302) by default. To return a permanent (301) redirection, pass `permanent = True`:

```python
api.redirect(url='/home', permanent=True)
```

### Templates

Bocadillo allows you to render [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org) templates.
You get all the niceties of the Jinja2 template engine:
a familiar templating language, automatic escaping, template inheritance, etc.

#### Rendering templates

You can render a template using `await api.template()`:

```python
async def post_detail(req, res):
    res.html = await api.template('index.html', title='Hello, Bocadillo!')
```

In synchronous views, use `api.template_sync()` instead:

```python
def post_detail(req, res):
    res.html = api.template_sync('index.html', title='Hello, Bocadillo!')
```

Context variables can also be given as a dictionary:

```python
await api.template('index.html', {'title': 'Hello, Bocadillo!'})
```

Lastly, you can render a template directly from a string:

```python
>>> api.template_string('<h1>{{ title }}</h1>', title='Hello, Bocadillo!')
'<h1>Hello, Bocadillo!</h1>'
```

#### Templates location

By default, Bocadillo looks for templates in the `templates/` folder relative
to where the app is executed. For example:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ templates
    â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

You can change the templates directory using the `templates_dir` option:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(templates_dir='path/to/templates')
```

### Static files

Bocadillo uses [WhiteNoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/) to serve
static assets for you in an efficient manner.

#### Basic usage

Place files in the `static` folder at the root location,
and they will be available at the corresponding URL:

```css
/* static/css/styles.css */
h1 { color: red; }
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/static/css/styles.css"
```

```
h1 { color: red; }
```

#### Static files location

By default, static assets are served at the `/static/` URL root and are
searched for in a `static/` directory relative to where the app is executed.
For example:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â””â”€â”€ static
    â””â”€â”€ css
        â””â”€â”€ styles.css
```

You can modify the static files directory using the `static_dir` option:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(static_dir='staticfiles')
```

To modify the root URL path, use `static_root`:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(static_root='assets')
```

#### Extra static files directories

You can serve other static directories using `app.mount()` and the
`static` helper:

```python
import bocadillo

api = bocadillo.API()

# Serve more static files located in the assets/ directory
api.mount(prefix='assets', app=bocadillo.static('assets'))
```

#### Disabling static files

To prevent Bocadillo from serving static files altogether,
you can use:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(static_dir=None)
```

### Error handling

#### Returning error responses

If you raise an `HTTPError` inside a view, Bocadillo will catch it and
return an appropriate response:

```python
from bocadillo.exceptions import HTTPError

@api.route('/fail/{status_code:d}')
def fail(req, res, status_code: int):
    raise HTTPError(status_code)
```

```bash
curl -SD - "http://localhost:8000/fail/403"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
server: uvicorn
date: Wed, 07 Nov 2018 19:55:56 GMT
content-type: text/plain
transfer-encoding: chunked

Forbidden
```

#### Customizing error handling

You can customize error handling by registering your own error handlers.
This can be done using the `@api.error_handler()` decorator:

```python
from bocadillo.exceptions import HTTPError

@api.error_handler(HTTPError)
def on_key_error(req, res, exc: HTTPError):
    res.status = exc.status_code
    res.media = {
        'status_code': exc.status_code,
        'detail': exc.status_phrase,
    }
```

For convenience, a non-decorator syntax is also available:

```python
def on_attribute_error(req, res, exc: AttributeError):
    res.status = 500
    res.media = {'error': {'attribute_not_found': exc.args[0]}}

api.add_error_handler(AttributeError, on_attribute_error)
```

### Middleware

> This feature is **experimental**; the middleware API may be subject to changes.

Bocadillo provides a simple middleware architecture in the form of middleware classes.

Middleware classes provide behavior for the entire application. They act as an intermediate between the ASGI layer and the Bocadillo API object. In fact, they implement the ASGI protocol themselves.

#### Routing middleware

Routing middleware performs operations before and after a request is routed to the Bocadillo application.

To define a custom routing middleware class, create a subclass of `bocadillo.RoutingMiddleware` and implement `.before_dispatch()` and `.after_dispatch()` as necessary:

```python
import bocadillo

class PrintUrlMiddleware(bocadillo.RoutingMiddleware):

    def before_dispatch(self, req):
        print(req.url)
    
    def after_dispatch(self, req, res):
        print(res.url)
```

> **Note**: the underlying application (which is either another routing middleware or the `API` object) is available on the `.app` attribute.

You can then register the middleware using `add_middleware()`:

```python
api = bocadillo.API()
api.add_middleware(PrintUrlMiddleware)
```

### CORS

Bocadillo has built-in support for [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (CORS). Adding CORS headers to responses is typically required when your API is to be accessed by web browsers.

To enable CORS, simply use:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(enable_cors=True)
```

Bocadillo has restrictive defaults to prevent security issues: empty `Allow-Origins`, only `GET` for `Allow-Methods`. To customize the CORS configuration, use `cors_config`, e.g.:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(
    enable_cors=True,
    cors_config={
        'allow_origins': ['*'],
        'allow_methods': ['*'],
    }
)
```

Please refer to Starlette's [CORSMiddleware](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/#corsmiddleware) documentation for the full list of options and defaults.

### HSTS

If you want enable [HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) (HSTS) and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, simply use:

```python
api = bocadillo.API(enable_hsts=True)
```

### Databases

> Databases are only available if Bocadillo was installed with the `[db]` extension. See [Extensions](#extensions).

Bocadillo integrates with the [Orator](https://orator-orm.com) ORM to provide database management features.

To configure a database with default parameters, use Boca's `init:db` command:

```bash
boca init:db
```

This will generate a `config` package and place the following file inside:

```python
# db.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from bocadillo.db import setup_db

load_dotenv()
db, Model, DATABASES = setup_db()
```

This file configures the database and provides you with the `db` object (an Orator `DatabaseManager`) and the base `Model` class. See the [Basic CRUD application](#basic-crud-application) guide for how these can be used to build and use models.

> **Note**: even when configured, the database will not be created until you apply database migrations (see [Running migrations](#running-migrations)).

#### Supported drivers

Bocadillo supports a number of database drivers:

| Database | Driver |
|----------|--------|
| SQLite | `sqlite` |
| MySQL | `mysql` |
| PostgreSQL | `pgsql` |

Note that extra packages are needed for certain drivers:

- `mysql`: requires installing [PyMySQL](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL) or [mysqlclient](https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python).
- `pgsql`: requires installing [psycopg2](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2).

> **Note**: all drivers are provided by Orator and should work as expected. If you encounter issues, please let us know.

#### Configuration parameters

There are a number of database configuration parameters, each of which can be set either explicitly or through environment variables, according to the following table.

| Option | Environment variable |
|----------|--------|
| `driver` | `DB_DRIVER` |
| `database` | `DB_NAME` |
| `user` | `DB_USER` |
| `password` | `DB_PASSWORD` |
| `host` | `DB_HOST` |
| `port` | `DB_PORT` |

#### Default configuration

When using `setup_db()` without any parameters, **all configuration will be retrieved from environment variables**.

If no environment variables are set, a SQLite database called `sqlite.db` will be configured by default. This is equivalent to setting `DB_DRIVER=sqlite` and `DB_NAME=sqlite.db`.

#### Customization

The recommended way of customizing database configuration is to use the environment variables specified in [Configuration parameters](#configuration-parameters). We recommended placing them in a `.env` file so that they are automatically loaded by [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/#installation) in the `db.py` script.

Alternatively, you can pass configuration parameters directly to `setup_db()`:

```python
# Uses the PostgreSQL driver.
# Retrieves host, port, user, password and database name from environment variables.
db, Model, DATABASES = setup_db(driver='pgsql')
```

#### Explicit configuration (advanced usage)

For advanced usages, `setup_db()` also accepts a `databases` argument, which expects a Python dictionary complying with the [Orator configuration](https://orator-orm.com/docs/0.9/basic_usage.html#configuration) format, i.e. a set of database aliases mapping to their configuration dictionary.

> **Note**: using this method, configuration will not be retrieved from environment variables, even if set. You'll need to retrieve them yourself using `os.getenv()`.

The following is equivalent to the default configuration:

```python
db, Model, DATABASES = setup_db(databases={
    'default': {
        'driver': 'sqlite',
        'database': 'sqlite.db',
    },
})
```

Notably, this method allows you to configure multiple databases by providing multiple aliases.

#### Using the ORM

Once the database is configured, you can use the full powers of Orator to build and use models in your Bocadillo app. Check out the [Basic CRUD application](#basic-crud-application) guide to get started!

### CLI

Bocadillo comes with `boca`, a handy CLI built with [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com) for performing common tasks when working on Bocadillo apps.

#### Basic usage

```
Usage: boca [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  help         Show help about boca.
  init:custom  Generate files required to build custom commands.
```

#### Custom commands

> **Note**: this feature is experimental. Use with care!

If you find yourself repeating certain tasks, you can automate them via a custom `boca` command.

To do so, use the `init:custom` command, which will generate the following file:

```python
# boca.py
"""Custom Bocadillo commands.

Use Click to build custom commands. For documentation, see:
https://click.palletsprojects.com
"""
from bocadillo.ext import click


@click.group()
def cli():
    pass

# Write your @cli.command() functions below.

```

The `cli` group will be picked up and its commands merged into `boca`, provided you are located at the same level than the custom commands script.

For example, let's add a `boca hello` command:

```python
# boca.py
@cli.command()
def hello():
    """Show a friendly message."""
    click.echo('Hello from a custom command!')
```

Now see it in action:

```
$ ls
app.py  boca.py
$ boca hello --help
Usage: boca hello [OPTIONS]

  Show a friendly message.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

$ boca hello
Hi from a custom command!
```

> **Tip**: the name of the custom commands file can be customized by setting the `BOCA_CUSTOM_COMMANDS_FILE` environment variable.

Of course, you can leverage Click's awesome features when building custom commands. See the [Click docs](https://click.palletsprojects.com) for more information.

## Guides

### Basic CRUD application

This guide shows you how to build a basic blog CRUD app using Bocadillo's database features.

#### Creating a model

To create a model, use the Orator CLI:

```bash
# -m also creates a migration
orator make:model Post -m
```

This generates a model and a migration file:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 2018_11_14_171748_create_posts_table.py
â””â”€â”€ models
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â””â”€â”€ post.py
```

Contrary to Django, with Orator model fields are specified directly in the migration, which has a number of advantages. This also means that the model is essentially an empty class, although generally define which fields are available when creating a new instance of the model, e.g.:

```python
# models/post.py

class Post:
    __fillable__ = ('title', 'slug', 'content')
```

For more information, see documentation on Orator's [ORM](https://orator-orm.com/docs/0.9/orm.html).

#### Writing migrations

Let's see how to add some fields onto the model, which is equivalent to adding columns to the `posts` table.

The migration file generated by Orator should be like the following:

```python
# 2018_11_14_171748_create_posts_table.py
from orator.migrations import Migration


class CreatePostsTable(Migration):

    def up(self):
        """
        Run the migrations.
        """
        with self.schema.create('posts') as table:
            table.increments('id')
            table.timestamps()

    def down(self):
        """
        Revert the migrations.
        """
        self.schema.drop('posts')
```

In `.up()`, you see the post's ID and timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are already specified. We can add more columns after them â€” that is, those we declared on the model's `__fields__`:

```python
def up(self):
    with self.schema.create('posts') as table:
        # ...
        table.char('title', 128)
        table.char('slug', 128)
        table.string('content')
```

Here, we add two `CHAR(128)` columns and one `VARCHAR` column. You can see the full reference on database columns in the docs for Orator's [Schema Builder](https://orator-orm.com/docs/0.9/schema_builder.html#).

#### Running migrations

Now that we wrote the migration, we can apply it:

```bash
orator migrate -c config/db.py
```

We can verify that migrations migrations have been applied:

```bash
orator migrate:status -c config/db.py
```

```
+--------------------------------------+------+
| Migration                            | Ran? |
+--------------------------------------+------+
| 2018_11_14_171748_create_posts_table | Yes  |
+--------------------------------------+------+
```

#### Using the model in views

Now that we created a model and migrated the database schema, we can use it in views.

How about we allow users to create, read and delete blog posts? Here is the corresponding full `app.py` file:

```python
# app.py
import bocadillo
from bocadillo.exceptions import HTTPError
from models.post import Post


api = bocadillo.API()


@api.route('/posts')
class PostsView:
    
    async def post(self, req, res):
        data = await req.json()
        post = Post.create(
            title=data['title'],
            slug=data['slug'],
            content=data['content'],
        )
        res.media = post.to_dict()
        res.status_code = 201

    async def get(self, req, res):
        res.media = [post.to_dict() for post in Post.all()]


@api.route('/posts/{pk:d}')
class PostDetailView:

    async def get(self, req, res, pk: int):
        post = Post.find(id=pk)
        if post is None:
            raise HTTPError(404)
        res.media = post.to_dict()

    async def delete(self, req, res, pk: int):
        post = Post.find(id=pk)
        if post is not None:
            post.delete()
        res.status_code = 204


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

There you go â€” a CRUD application in Bocadillo! ðŸ¥™
